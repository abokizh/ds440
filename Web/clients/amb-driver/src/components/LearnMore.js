      This web app assists hospitals by bridging the communication gap between
      Ambulance driver and hospital management especially during emergency
      cases. This web app successfully tracks and alerts hospital management by
      which delay in treatment of patient can be reduced. This could potentially
      save lives. This webapp notifies hospital when an ambulance is within 3km
      range of a hospital. This will be very useful at times of emergency cases
      which assists in timely treatement of patients. This works by tracking
      ambulance location(coordinates) in real-time. The location stats will also
      be updated in realtime on hospital's display board.
